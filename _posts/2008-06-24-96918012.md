#### War Has Changed ####

It's an endless series of proxy battles,fought by mercenaries and machines war,and its vast consumption of human life, has become a rational,well-oiled business transaction.

**War has changed.** 

Id-tagged soldiers carry id-tagged weapons, use id-tagged gear, nanomachines inside their bodies enhance and regulate their actions.

genetic control,information control, emotion control,battelfield control;
everything is monitored, and kept under control.

**War has changed.** 

The age of deterrence is now the age of control,averting catastrophe from weapons of mass destruction and he who controls the battlefield, controls history.

**War has changed.** 

When the battle field is under total control, war becomes routine.
